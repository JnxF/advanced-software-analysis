# Static program analysis by Abstract Interpretation, algorithms

Learning outcomes:
1. You know the high-level steps of static analysis via abstract interpretation
2. You know why these steps make sense â€” or, under which conditions are they sound
3. You get an idea on how to implement a static analyzer
4. You touch on some funny abstract interpretation algorithms; you know where to search if you are need more information on the field.
